# libbase-chromium
Trimmed Chromium base library, based on Google chromium version 51. I have tested it on Android only but it should work on general Linux.

## Features
This library supports many useful things such as string and file utilities.

If the code you use already defines a LOG macro, check out the chromium\_log branch which change the LOG to CHROMIUM\_LOG macro.

## Related work
This library is more light-weighted and has less features than another more fully extracted Chromium base library [chromium-base](https://github.com/topillar/chromium-base).
